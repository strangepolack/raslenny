# This is the file with commands for initiating your RasPbx box.
# Lines starting with a hash "#" are disregarded; they are just comments in Linux.
# Some lines may contain 2 hashes inside, that separate text blocks.
# That is meaningful!!!
# These lines will be treated as having the following structure: "command#question#answer".
# They are for interactive commands.
# Meaning, commands asking during the installation questions like "Do you want to continue? [Y/n]"
# And that happens somewhere in the middle of the process.
# These lines are for auto answering such questions.
# Other lines not starting with a "#" are normal Linux commands.
# The script using these command may be ran from time to time, in order to upgrade your pbx box.
# Even though some packets may be already in place, they will be just replaced or upgraded.
